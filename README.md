ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FabienLebas !

French. Working at Decathlon since 2002.

Currently Product Manager for 2 products linked to e-commerce returns. The tool for warehouse teammates to input returned parcels from customers (java and Angluar) and a back-end tool to link the return with the customer's original order (java). 

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in technology. 

I have a Masters degree in Supply Chain Management in 2001. Supply chain project manager during 8 years.

International experience: 2 years opening e-commerce websites outside of France, and 3 years opening new countries for Decathlon (the first store in a new country = Mexico & San Francisco). These 2 jobs were still located in Lille, France. Then I spent 3.5 years as an RFID Leader in Moscow, Russia (launched an app to control store deliveries thanks to the RFID technology. [See End2End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpQ7o4XctqA&t=4s). I also launched an app like a mini WMS for stores, helping them with logistical processes. [See Product Locator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9I4zJUXAFU&t=5s)

I have learned the basics of coding during my studies but came to a professional level thanks to a 3 months intensive training in 2017. Javascript. NodeJS. React. HTML. CSS. PostgreSQL. Coding full-stack. I coded myself 2 apps now used in Decathlon: Product Locator and End2End (then recruited and managed developers to grow faster).
