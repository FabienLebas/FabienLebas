👋 Hi, I’m @FabienLebas !

French. Working at Decathlon since 2002.

Currently RFID Leader in Russia. And data team leader

👀 I’m interested in technology. 

I have a Masters degree in Supply Chain Management in 2001. Supply chain project manager during 8 years.

International experience: 2 years opening e-com websites outside of France, 3 years opening new countries for Decathlon (the first store in a new country = Mexico & San Francisco). Since 2018 I live in Moscow.

I have learnt basics of coding during my studies but came to professional level thanks to a 3 months intensive training in 2017. Javascript. NodeJS. React. Coding full-stack.

🌱 I’m currently working on: 

Main subject = RFID gates (to control the accuracy of deliveries. And autonomous robots inside the stores. [See End2End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbi0JGALp0Q&t=8s)

Side project (10% of my time) = helping stores manage their overstock. Or small warehouses. Just with a phone. [See Product Locator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9I4zJUXAFU&t=5s)
